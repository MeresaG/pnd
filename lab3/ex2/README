A lan with a host, a server, a router and the attacker machine.
In the attacker machine you have to install ettercap and perform
a MITM attack. Ettercap does this with the ARP poisoning
This must be done with the --privileged option of kathara lstart (a bit rough...).

- Set up the links as for ex1, so that the victim machine can be the hosting box

- Verify the arp poisoning is effective

- Try to use the filter for images already in the a1 folder to alter the image
