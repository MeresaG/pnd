One router with two lan, both with 2 pcs. The router is connected with
an ISP router. The assignment is: to configure the topology to use IPv6
addresses. The ISP makes use of a DHCPv6 server for address and prefix
distribution. The router has to ask prefixes to its ISP and has to distribute
addresses inside the two lans, using SLAAC.
You are supposed to use the dibbler DHCPv6 client to make r1 asking for
prefix delegation and (optionally) for an address.

The ISP is already configure to provide prefixes, while the router and the
pcs have to be configured.

- the router has always 1 in the host part of its own link local address.

- you will have to use a script to make router assigning an address to
  the interface in the network of the prefix. This will be used as the
  address radvd will advertise in the network for SLAAC configuration.
